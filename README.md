The white image has a higher mean and standard deviation compared to the black image, indicating that it is brighter and has more variation in pixel intensities.
 the standard deviation of the white image is higher because it contains more light and thus more variation in pixel values, while the black image is darker and has less variation.
the white standard deviation is 170 times higher than the black standard deviation
 the Signal to noise ratio tells the same story with the white SNR being 20% and the black image at .3%
